//! # Rips - Rust IP Stack
//!
//! [`rips`](https://github.com/faern/librips) is a TCP/IP stack implemented in
//! Rust and backed by [`libpnet`](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet) for its
//! raw ethernet access.
//!
//! **WARNING**: This is not a *complete* TCP/IP stack at the moment.
//! It's a work in progress. Continue to read to see what works at the moment.
//! Feedback and ideas on the implementation and this documentation is very
//! welcome. This is my first TCP/IP stack implementation so help will probably
//! be needed in order to make this library complete and correct.
//! Most of this is implemented from observations of how other stacks seem to
//! work, I have not studied any other implementations in detail.
//!
//! Linux and OS X builds:
//! [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/faern/librips.
//! svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/faern/librips)
//!
//! - [rnetcat](https://github.com/faern/rnetcat) - A Netcat like program based
//! on rips.
//! - [ripstest](https://github.com/faern/ripstest) - A small crate with some
//! usage examples of different layers of rips.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate rips;
//!
//! let stack = rips::default_stack();
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!

//!
//! ## Architecture and terminology
//!
//! ### Sending
//!
//! Rips contains a number of structs with names ending in *Tx*,
//! eg. `EthernetTx`, `ArpTx`, `Ipv4Tx`, `UdpTx`. We call them *tx-objects*, or
//! transmit objects. The tx-objects are building the header for their protocols
//! and are supposed to be as simple as possible.
//! The constructors of the tx-objects take an instance of a tx-object
//! belonging to the underlying protocol, eg. both `ArpTx` and `Ipv4Tx`
//! takes an `EthernetTx`, while `UdpTx` takes an `Ipv4Tx`[1].
//! The constructors also take whatever values are needed to build their
//! respective packets, usually source and destination addresses and similar.
//!
//! At the bottom of the stack there is a `Tx` instance for every interface in
//! the stack. View the `Tx` struct as the base tx-object.
//! The `Tx` holds the sending part of the `pnet` backend and a simple counter
//! behind a `Mutex`. Whenever anything in the stack changes, such as updates
//! to the Arp or routing tables, the counter inside the `Tx` is incremented
//! automatically by the stack. The `Tx` also holds the counter value from when
//! it was created. When any tx-object is used to send a packet the sending
//! will propagate down and eventually reach the `Tx` at the bottom. There the
//! `Mutex` is locked and the counter from the creation of that `Tx` is
//! compared to the counter behind the lock.
//! If the counters are equal the packet is transmitted on the network,
//! otherwise a `TxError::InvalidTx` is returned. The reason for this is that
//! every tx-object should be kept simple and not do any lookups against routing
//! tables etc when they construct their packets.
//! As long as nothing changes inside the stack all transmissions can go ahead
//! with no locking or lookups inside their `send` methods. As soon as a change
//! happens inside the stack all existing tx-objects become invalid and must be
//! recreated (which is cheap).
//!
//! [1]: This will change when IPv6 is implemented so that `UdpTx` can be used
//! on top of both.
//!
//! ### Receiving
//!
//! Just as every protocol in the stack has a struct whose name ends in *Tx*
//! for transmission, it has a corresponding struct ending in *Rx* that is
//! used for parsing incoming packets.
//!
//! The rx-objects behave a little bit different on different levels of the
//! stack. At the bottom the listeners are fixed and given in the constructor
//! to avoid locking at each level on every incoming packets. Further up the
//! stack the listeners are `HashMap`s behind `Mutex`es that can be changed
//! throughout the life of the stack to accomodate added and removed sockets.
//!
//! Work will be done to reduce locking on the receiving end. However,
//! optimization comes after functionality, so that will be done later.
//!
//! ### tests
//!
//! This crate contains both unit tests and integration tests, both placed
//! where the Rust book recommends them to be. The problem is that I need
//! to do some mocking in the unit tests to be able to swap out the real
//! dependencies with fake ones, so I can test individual structs without
//! initializing too many other structs. At the moment this is solved
//! with conditional compilation. When the feature "unit-tests" is active
//! dependencies will be swapped out for mocks that exist in `rips::test`.
//!
//! The bundled script `test.sh` is a tiny script that will execute both the
//! unit tests and the integration tests.
//!
//! Ideas on how to solve this in a better way is welcome. However, the
//! requirements are that the solution does not bloat the production version
//! of the code noticeably. Static dispatch can't be changed into dynamic
//! dispatch just to allow testing.
//!
//! ## Unsolved Questions
//!
//! Here are a few problems that I ran into that I still did not solve.
//! Feedback is welcome.
//!
//! * If it's possible to have the same IP on multiple interfaces, which one
//!   will a socket bound to that local IP receive packets from? Both?
//! * Should the IP layer reassemble fragmented packets that are out of order?
//! * Should the `FooTx` structs not contain the underlying `BarTx` and do the
//!   sending internally. But instead be agnostic of the underlying protocol.
//!
